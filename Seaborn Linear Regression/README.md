### In this lesson, we're going to be looking at movie budget and revenue data. 
This dataset is perfect for trying out some new tools like scikit-learn to run a linear regression and seaborn, a popular data visualisation library built on top of Matplotlib. 
The question we want to answer today is: Do higher film budgets lead to more revenue in the box office? In other words, should a movie studio spend more on a film to make more? 

### Today you'll learn:
1. How to use a popular data visualisation library called Seaborn.
1. How to run and interpret a linear regression with scikit-learn.
1. How to plot a regression a scatter plot to visualise relationships in the data.
1. How to add a third dimension to a scatter plot to create a bubble chart.
1. How to cleverly use floor division // to convert your data.

### Learning Points & Summary
1. Use nested loops to remove unwanted characters from multiple columns.
1. Filter Pandas DataFrames based on multiple conditions using both .loc[] and .query().
1. Create bubble charts using the Seaborn Library.
1. Style Seaborn charts using the pre-built styles and by modifying Matplotlib parameters.
1. Use floor division (i.e., integer division) to convert years to decades.
1. Use Seaborn to superimpose a linear regressions over our data.
1. Make a judgement if our regression is good or bad based on how well the model fits our data and the r-squared metric.
1. Run regressions with scikit-learn and calculate the coefficients.
