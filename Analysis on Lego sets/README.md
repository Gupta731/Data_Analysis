## Learn to Aggregate and Merge Data in Pandas while Analysing a Dataset of LEGO Pieces
Today we're going to be diving deep into a dataset all about LEGO, which will help us answer a whole bunch of interesting questions about the history of the company, their product offering, and which LEGO set rules them all:

1. What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created and how many parts did it have?

1. In which year were the first LEGO sets released and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?

1. Which LEGO theme has the most sets? Is it Harry Potter, Ninjago, Friends or something else?

1. When did the LEGO company really take-off based on its product offering? How many themes and sets did it release every year?

1. Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?

### Learning Points & Summary
1. Use HTML Markdown in Notebooks, such as section headings # and how to embed images with the <img> tag.

1. Combine the groupby() and count() functions to aggregate data

1. Use the .value_counts() function

1. Slice DataFrames using the square bracket notation e.g., df[:-2] or df[:10]

1. Use the .agg() function to run an operation on a particular column

1. Rename() columns of DataFrames

1. Create a line chart with two separate axes to visualise data that have different scales.

1. Create a scatter plot in Matplotlib

1. Work with tables in a relational database by using primary and foreign keys

1. .merge() DataFrames along a particular column

1. Create a bar chart with Matplotlib
