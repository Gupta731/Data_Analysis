### No Data Science course can be complete without learning NumPy (Numerical Python). 
### NumPy is a Python library thatâ€™s used in almost every field of science and engineering. Itâ€™s practically THE standard for working with numerical data in Python.

### Today we will learn:
1. How to leverage the power ðŸ’ª of NumPy's ndarrays.
1. How to access individual values and subsets inside an n-dimensional array.
1. How broadcasting ðŸ“£ works with ndarrays.
1. How to do linear algebra with NumPy.
1. How to generate points that you can plot on a chart.
1. How to manipulate images as ndarrays.

### Learning Points & Summary
In this lesson we looked at how to:
1. Create arrays manually with np.array()
1. Generate arrays using  .arange(), .random(), and .linspace()
1. Analyse the shape and dimensions of a ndarray.
1. Slice and subset a ndarray based on its indices.
1. Do linear algebra like operations with scalars and matrix multiplication.
1. Use NumPys broadcasting to make ndarray shapes compatible.
1. Manipulate images in the form of ndarrays.
